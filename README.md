# Javascript

This repository is all about javascript learning. 
I have included basic, intermediate and advanced concept of javascript.

Concept like DOM - Document Object Modelling, Higher Order Function, Event are described as much as beginner friendly it can be. 

## Project
I have also added project along with it for the practices while I was learning.

There is a separate section of project, you can find when you deep dive into this repository.
